# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Movie-Reviews-using-LSTM-with-Word2Vec-Embeddings
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques applied to the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, removal of HTML tags, punctuation, URLs, tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a deep learning model trained on IMDB movie reviews. The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiments. The analysis involves extensive text preprocessing, tokenization, and the use of Word2Vec embeddings for word vectorization.
